        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>During my internship, I contributed to the development of RPG systems and mechanics using Unreal Engine 5. This included designing and implementing character systems, combat mechanics, and quest design to create an immersive RPG experience.</p>

        <h3>Key Contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed character systems, including attributes, leveling, and skill trees.</li>
            <li>Implemented combat mechanics, such as melee and ranged attacks, and enemy AI behavior.</li>
            <li>Designed and integrated quest systems, including objectives, rewards, and progression tracking.</li>
            <li>Collaborated with a team of developers and designers to ensure seamless integration of features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Tech Stack Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> – For game development and implementation.</li>
            <li><strong>Blueprints</strong> – For visual scripting and rapid prototyping.</li>
        </ul>
