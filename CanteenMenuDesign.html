        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Luccman as <strong>Designer</strong><br>
        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Canteen Menu Design</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Local School Canteen</p>
        <p>In this project, I designed two large banners for a school canteen to display their menu. The designs were tailored to two specific audiences: kids and teachers. Each design reflects the unique preferences and needs of its target audience.</p>

        <h2>Designs</h2>

        <h3>Kids' Menu</h3>
        <p>The kids' menu design features a light mode theme with playful background sketches of food items and school-related elements. The goal was to create a fun and engaging design that appeals to children.</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="Pictures/SchoolMenu1.png" alt="Kids Menu Design" width="1200rem">
        </div>

        <h3>Teachers' Menu</h3>
        <p>The teachers' menu design uses a dark mode theme with subtle random icons in the background. The design is sleek and professional, catering to the preferences of the teaching staff.</p>

            <img src="Pictures/SchoolMenu2.png" alt="Teachers Menu Design" width="1200rem">
        </div>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <h3>Concept Development:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Conducted discussions with the canteen staff to understand their requirements and target audiences.</li>
            <li>Created initial sketches and mood boards for both designs.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Design Creation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For the kids' menu, used bright colors and hand-drawn sketches to create a playful and inviting look.</li>
            <li>For the teachers' menu, used a dark color palette with clean typography and subtle iconography for a professional feel.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Implementation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Coordinated with a local print shop to produce high-quality banners.</li>
            <li>Ensured the banners were prominently displayed in the canteen for maximum visibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kids' Menu:</strong> Light mode with playful sketches and bright colors.</li>
            <li><strong>Teachers' Menu:</strong> Dark mode with clean typography and subtle icons.</li>
            <li><strong>High-Quality Printing:</strong> Ensured durability and vibrant colors for both designs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>The designs were well-received by both the students and teachers, enhancing the canteen's atmosphere and making the menu more accessible and visually appealing.</p>
